# About the Project
All About Einstein is a question-answering application focused on Albert Einstein. Utilizing the knowledge base extracted from the [Britannica Albert Einstein encyclopedia](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-Einstein), this project employs [instructor text embeddings](https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-xl) and the [FLAN-T5 LLM model](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl) from Hugging Face. The user-friendly interface, designed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), and the application's pipeline is constructed using the [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) framework, enabling users to pose a wide range of questions related to Albert Einstein's life and work.

# Setup
1. install the dependecies needed\
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Add yout huggingface API key to the `.env` file in your directory \
   ```HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_secrit_api_key```

# Usage
1. Ensure that you have installed the required dependencies adn added the huggingface API key to the `.env` file
2. In the terminal, run this command:\
   ```streamlit run app.py```
3. The app will launch in you default web, displaying the UI
4. Ask a question about Albert Einstein!
