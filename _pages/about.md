I'm a dedicated explorer in the realm of artificial intelligence, with a particular passion for delving into the intricate world of machine learning. My journey has led me to the fascinating realm of data modeling, where I revel in crafting solutions for both structured and unstructured data. Whether it's unraveling the secrets of computer vision, deciphering the nuances of natural language processing, or navigating the complexities of time series analysis, I find my greatest joy in these intellectual adventures.

I currently wear the hat of an Associate Researcher at the Research Center for Artificial Intelligence and Big Data (AIDA) at Universitas Padjadjaran. Within these dynamic walls, I orchestrate experiments that dance at the intersection of computer vision and NLP. As I continue to expand my horizons, I will soon be embarking on a new academic journey, pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Monash University in Australia.
