In the 2021/2022 academic year, I served as a teaching assistant for the programming class. Through interactive sessions and practical exercises, I guided freshman students in demystifying programming concepts and honing their skills in Python coding. My role aimed to empower students to leverage programming as a tool to enhance their statistical analysis capabilities, bridging theory with real-world application.

For your reference, I've attached my certificate for this role.
