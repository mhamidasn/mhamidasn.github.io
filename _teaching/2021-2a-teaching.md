In the 2021/2022 academic year, I served as a teaching assistant for the Multivariate Data Analysis 1 practicum class, designed to guide sophomore statistics students in unlocking insights from complex datasets. Through interactive sessions and hands-on exercises, I facilitated their exploration of techniques like PCA and cluster analysis, fostering both technical proficiency and critical thinking skills. My role aimed to empower students with the ability to navigate intricate data landscapes and glean meaningful patterns from multidimensional datasets.

For your reference, I've attached my certificate for this role.
