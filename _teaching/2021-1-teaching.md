In the 2020/2021 academic year, I served as an assistant teacher for a database practicum class tailored to freshman statistics students. Guiding these budding statisticians, I facilitated interactive sessions to explore the intricacies of database management. Through hands-on exercises, I empowered them to apply database principles to real-world statistical analysis. This experience ignited their passion for data-driven insights and equipped them with valuable technical skills for their academic and professional journeys.

For your reference, I've attached my certificate for this role.
